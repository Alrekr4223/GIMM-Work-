 - Debug the console log on a android phone - 

Connect an android phone to the PC and push the app from Unity to the phone. 

Open command prompt. Navigate to C:/Users/Labuser/Appdata/local/android/sdk/platform-tools.*
*Note: 'Labuser' would be your user on the computer. 'Labuser' is used on GIMM Lab computers.
*Note: You may need to change hidden folders to unhidden to find Appdata. 

Once at platform-tools on the command prompt, run the following command: 
adb logcat -s Unity ActivityManager PackageManager dalvikvm DEBUG

This will allow you to see all actions taken by the currently connected android phone.
